# Introduction
This project is a fork of [Chrome exentsion - Smooth Gestures](https://github.com/chews/Smooth-Gestures) by [@chews](https://github.com/chews). Due to [the unfortunate event](http://codeonfire.cthru.biz/?p=96), the project seems stopped. The fork tries to continue the effort for my own sake. Thanks [@zTrix](https://github.com/zTrix) for removing the Java codes which obfuscate the project.

# Goals
The continuing effort will be:

1. Remove the malicious codes which send usage data and decrease extension performance.
2. Continue the bug fixing and improve the functionality.
